python-altcoinlib
-----------------

This Python2/3 library provides a wrapper around Peter Todd's python-bitcoinlib,
extending it in order to add altcoin support (initially Dogecoin). Please
consult python-bitcoinlib's documentation for an API overview.


Unit tests
----------

Under altcoin/tests are unit tests based on data extracted from Dogecoin blockchains. To
run the tests:

python -m unittest discover
python3 -m unittest discover
